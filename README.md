Wyncode Homework Mockup

#Objective
To demonstrate beginner abilities of HTML and CSS by recreating a mockup of a google search results page from an image.

##Summary
Looks great on desktop, but is not responsive. And needs to be more consistent with sizing (px, em, %). Attempts to properly use flex box and other modern web dev techniques. 

###Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Tommy for helping me start over, when all hope was lost.
